# Rational

Implement GIT using this tutorial: https://wyag.thb.lt.  
Tho tutorial is written in Python, but to make things more interesting, this project will be written in C++.  
Also, this tutorial doesn't contain implementation of major git features, so they will be implemented here.

# TODO

- [ ] Implement staging area(git add, git status).
- [ ] Implement merge.
- [ ] Implement diff.
